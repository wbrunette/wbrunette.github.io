      I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/">School of Computer and Cyber Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.augusta.edu/">Augusta University</a>.
	  My research interests include mobile computing, computing for development, ubiquitous computing, wireless sensor networks, sensor-enhanced computing, edge computing, and smart applications. Specifically, I am interested in using devices, sensors, services, and interfaces to create computer systems that integrate seamlessly into a userâ€™s environment allowing technology to fade into the background of daily life. I often combine systems research with building edge technology to support global health, humanitarian assistance, and international development by creating software frameworks to simplify building and managing domain-specific mobile applications in resource-constrained environments. For information services to be successful in resource-constrained environments, software needs to be robust and flexible enough to be composable by non-programmers and be deployable by resource-constrained organizations using primarily consumer services and devices. Isolating reusable framework components from the user-configurable application components can reduce the skill required to customize applications.

      Before joining Augusta University, I completed my PhD at the University of Washington's <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/">Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering</a> where I was one of the founders of the <a href="https://www.opendatakit.org/">Open Data Kit Project</a>.
